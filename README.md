- Created a unique identity for **robot-001**
- Wrote a small Python script that simulates the robot uploading telemetry
- Confirmed that the robot **can write to its own folder**, but **cannot access other robots’ folders**

This verified that **least privilege access is working correctly**.

## Next Steps (Slow and Steady)

☐ Add logging review using CloudTrail 
☐ Detect denied access attempts 
☐ Add another robot identity and test isolation  
☐ Document what happens when things break (on purpose)
☐ Prepare a short demo video for the repo 

No rush. Just one piece at a time.

## Mindset

The purpose isn’t to build the “perfect” security system. 
The purpose is to **understand what’s happening** and learn how to reason about security choices.
